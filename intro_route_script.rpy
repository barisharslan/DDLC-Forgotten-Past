    "I am so extremely exhausted, however, I have to start my usual walk to school."
    "I have to make my way over as much as I dread it…"
    "The school year started just around a month ago, yet I'm already back to the same routine I was in last year."
    "I go to school and do mediocre in all my classes, spacing out through each one, as a tile on the wall is more interesting than the lectures..."
    "Then, I head home and do my homework before watching anime or playing games till 3 am."
    "It’s not the most complex routine but that's part of the beauty of it."
    "What’s not so beautiful is the amount of sleep I get."

    "???" "Heeeeeeey!"
    mc "I hear a voice that’s all too familiar."
    "I turn around with a smile on my face."

    "As I turn I see my clumsy childhood friend Sayori."
    mc "Well, well, well! Look what the cat dragged in."
    mc "Finally decided to grace me with your presence after you started oversleeping every day."

    s 1r "Ehe~ sorry [player] but you know I need sleep unlike someone."
    mc "Well then maybe don’t stay up so late!"

    "I smile at our banter."
    "It's the first time I've seen her in months and here we are teasing each other like nothing even happened."

    mc "Anyways how’ve ya been!"

    s "I’ve been the same as always. How about you, [player]?"
    mc "Come on Sayori, you know all I do is wait for the new chapters of Hunter Vs Hunter!"
    mc "At this point it should be called Hiatus Vs Hiatus though…"

    "Sayori giggles a bit."

    mc "Hey, it’s true. The author even stated he will um… finish, \"sometime before he dies…\""
    s "Are you still addicted to playing Light Souls?"
    mc "Hey, don’t make fun of me."
    s "No no! You’re really good!"
    mc "Well…"

    "We continue to chit chat like this on our way to school"
    "I don’t think much of our conversation until she says something that catches my attention."

    s "You know, I actually recently helped with starting a club!"
    mc "Oh really now? What club?"
    s "It's the literature club! We hold a meeting afterschool daily in room 28 of the third year floor."
    mc "Oh really? Interesting."

    "I had been thinking of joining a club."
    "I’ve also been meaning to expand my horizons, since all I do is watch anime, read manga, and play games."
    "Plus this could be a wonderful chance to reconnect with an old pal."
    "Maybe I'll have to check this club out after school."
